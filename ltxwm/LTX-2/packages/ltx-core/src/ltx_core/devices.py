"""Device abstraction for CUDA, Apple Silicon (MPS), and CPU backends.
Centralizes backend detection and the handful of APIs that genuinely differ
across accelerators (synchronization, allocator cache, memory queries, RNG
state). Selection order is CUDA -> MPS -> CPU.
CUDA-only optimizations (FlashAttention, Triton blockwise FP8/FP6,
bitsandbytes, NCCL) are gated at their call sites, not here. MPS in particular
has no ``float64`` support and no fp8 dtype support; use
:func:`highest_precision_float` to stay within what the backend can represent.
