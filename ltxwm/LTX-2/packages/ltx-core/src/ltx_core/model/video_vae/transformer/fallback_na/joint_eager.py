"""Pure-torch joint (video + keyframe) 3D neighborhood attention.
Computes, for one softmax per query:
* **video query** at ``(t, h, w)``: its local ``Kt x Kh x Kw`` video window, clamped to the
  volume and masked where it hangs over the edge, **plus** the whole ``Kh x Kw`` window at the
  same ``(h, w)`` on each of the ``num_slots`` nearest keyframe planes. Keyframe visibility does
  not depend on ``Kt`` -- a plane far outside the temporal radius is still visible.
* **keyframe query** on plane ``i``: the ``Kh x Kw`` window on its own plane (there is no
  plane-to-plane attention), plus the same window on each of the nearest video frames.
Which planes and frames are "nearest" comes from :func:`video_keyframe_slots` /
:func:`keyframe_video_slots`, so every backend agrees on visibility.
No Triton, no natten, no ``torch.compile``: this is the backend that always exists -- CPU,
macOS/MPS, Windows without a built extra.
Structure
---------
Everything is arranged so the arithmetic happens inside ``F.scaled_dot_product_attention``:
**Query bricks.** Queries are grouped into ``(bt, bh, bw)`` bricks and many bricks ride one SDPA
call as its batch dimension, so a frame costs a handful of launches rather than thousands. All
queries in a brick share one gathered key slab, of extent ``(bt + Kt - 1, bh + Kh - 1, bw + Kw - 1)``.
**Brick shape.** Wasted work is ``Nk / keys_actually_visible`` and *grows* with the brick, so the
spatial face stays small and square (square minimizes the slab at a fixed query count). Depth is
the exception: the gather is the larger cost and it scales with ``Nk / Nq``, which *falls* with
depth, so :data:`DEFAULT_BRICK_DEPTH` frames deep beats one frame deep despite doing more
arithmetic. Both defaults sit on measured plateaus at the production stage-5 shape.
**One shared, 2D-broadcast mask.** The visible-key pattern is a property of the brick geometry,
identical for every brick, so it is built once and passed as ``(1, 1, Nq, Nk)``. That shape is
load-bearing: torch keeps the memory-efficient backend and expands neither the mask nor the
scores, whereas a pre-expanded ``(G, NH, Nq, Nk)`` bias halves throughput and costs gigabytes.
**Per-key validity rides in the keys.** Out-of-volume positions, empty slots (``-1``) and invalid
planes are data-dependent, so folding them into the mask would make it per-brick. Instead ``K``
carries one extra channel holding ``0`` for a live key and :data:`_DEAD` for a dead one, against a
constant ``1`` channel on ``Q``. Q arrives pre-scaled, so with ``scale=1.0`` that adds exactly the
bias to the score. The channel count is then rounded up to :data:`_HEAD_DIM_ALIGN`.
**Head-major staging.** Key slabs are gathered from a ``(B, NH, A, Hp, Wp, C)`` copy rather than
from the caller's channels-last layout, so the gather's innermost contiguous run is ``ew * C``
instead of ``C``.
**Runs of constant slot row.** A brick spanning several frames shares one keyframe key slab, so it
must not straddle a change of visible planes. ``T`` is cut into maximal runs of identical slot rows
and bricks are tiled inside a run -- which also means one plane gather per run, entering the slab
view with a **zero** group stride.
Both loops are budgeted by :data:`DEFAULT_WORKSPACE_BYTES`: frames per staging pass, then
``(bricks, brick rows)`` per SDPA call. Peak transient memory is therefore bounded by that budget
and not by the volume, which is what lets this sit next to a decoder that has its own memory plan.
The gather is the floor: SDPA needs materialized ``(G, NH, Nk, HD)`` keys, so every key is copied
``Nk / Nq`` times. Only a fused neighborhood kernel avoids that.
